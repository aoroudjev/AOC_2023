# Rust Solutions for Advent of Code

## About The Project

### Description
This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code (AOC) challenges implemented in Rust. Advent of Code is an annual series of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. This repository aims to explore the capabilities and performance of Rust in solving these puzzles.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to:
- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Explore Rust's unique features like ownership, lifetimes, and concurrency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Rust: Follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust and Cargo.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aoroudjev/AOC_2023.git
   ```

## Usage
Each day's solution is saved in its own `dayXX.rs` int he `bin` directory and input is in the `\input` directory as `dayXX.txt`. 

To run a solution, use:
