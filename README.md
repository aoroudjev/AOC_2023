# Rust Solutions for Advent of Code

## About The Project

### Description
This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code (AOC) challenges implemented in Rust. Advent of Code is an annual series of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. This repository aims to explore the capabilities and performance of Rust in solving these puzzles.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to:
- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Explore Rust's unique features like ownership, lifetimes, and concurrency.
- Build a community of Rust enthusiasts and learners.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Rust: Follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust and Cargo.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aoc-rust.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory of a specific day's challenge:
```shell
cd day_01
```

## Usage
Each day's directory contains two main files: `main.rs` and `input.txt`. `main.rs` contains the solution code, and `input.txt` contains the puzzle input.

To run a solution, use:
```shell
cargo run --release
```
